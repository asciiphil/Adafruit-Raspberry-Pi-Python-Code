class TSL2561(object):
    """Main class for interacting with a TSL2561 light sensor.

    The constructor takes several named parameters, all optional:
    * address - The I2C address of the TSL2561 chipset.  The class defines three
      constants for the possible chipset addresses:
      * ADDR_LOW - The address used when the ADDR SEL terminal is connected to
        ground.
      * ADDR_FLOAT - The address used when the ADDR SEL terminal is not
        connected to anything.  This is the default address.
      * ADDR_HIGH - The address used when the ADDR SEL terminal is connected to
        V_DD (the bus voltage).
    * mode - The mode of operation for the lux readings.  The class defines two
      constants for the two possible operating modes:
      * MODE_CONTINUOUS - The sensor is activated when the TSL2561 object is
        initialized.  The `lux` property will return immediately with whatever
        the sensor's current reading is, but that reading is only updated at
        intervals specified by the `integrationTime` parameter.  This mode is ideal
        for relatively continuous readings.  This is the default mode.
      * MODE_SINGLE - The sensor is normally off.  Every time the `lux` property is
        read, the sensor is turned on, the program sleeps for `integrationTime`
        milliseconds, the sensor data is read, the sensor is turned off, and the
        lux value is returned.  This mode is ideal if sensor readings are only
        needed occasionally and you don't want the sensor drawing current all the
        time.
    * gain - The gain applied to sensor readings.  See the `gain` class property
      for more information and acceptable values.  Defaults to 1.
    * integrationTime - The integration time in milliseconds for a sensor
      reading.  See the `integrationTime` class property for more information
      and acceptable values.  Defaults to 402.
    * debug - Controls whether additional debugging information is printed as
      the class performs its functions.  Defaults to False.

    To use the class, simply instantiate it and then check the `lux` parameter
    for sensor readings.  The `gain` and `integrationTime` properties may be
    used to alter the sensor's parameters between readings.

    Manual integration intervals are not currently supported.
    Interrupts are not currently supported.
